# CC Points System

CC Points System is a Clash of Clans war farming points tracker made by kuilin.

## Dev Environment

Since everything is dockerized, only docker and docker-compose are required to get everything running.

Copy `docker-compose.dev.yml` or `docker-compose.prod.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and then modify them as needed. Then, `docker-compose up -d` to start.
