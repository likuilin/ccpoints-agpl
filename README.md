FWA Points website project. Live at https://fwapoints.chocolateclash.com

## Environment

Since everything is dockerized, only docker and docker-compose are required to get everything running.

Copy `docker-compose.dev.yml` or `docker-compose.prod.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and then modify things as needed. Then, `docker-compose up -d` to start.
